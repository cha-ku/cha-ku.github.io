Hello, I am Chaitanya. I like coding in Python and C++. I have worked on workflow automation, build infrastructure and a little bit on graphics programming.
Very recently I have started taking interest in low-level systems programming and I am looking for projects and jobs in the same domain.
Thanks for dropping in!
